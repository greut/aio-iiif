<h1>Asyncio IIIF</h1>
<p>
An experiment following my <a href="https://github.com/greut/iiif">iiif</a> project built around Tom√°s' <a href="http://github.com/h2non/bimg">bimg</a>. It also relies on the amazing John Cupitt's <a href="https://jcupitt.github.io/libvips/">libvips</a> but using Python rather than Go.
